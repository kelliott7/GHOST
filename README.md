# GHOST - Gyroscopic Handheld Orientation Simulation Tool
**A tabletop Three Axis Motion Simulator that takes input from the orientation of an Android device via Bluetooth communication. The center platform of the TAMS is moved by pitch, roll, and yaw motors to match the angular position of the phone.**
## GHOST App
#### To download the GHOST app
1. Open this link: https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryid=b9d5481b-f452-4536-bab6-d944d49cb560

## ghostMain.ino Arduino Sketch
#### Running the sketch
- Upload to Arduino Uno board by clicking the arrow
- Sketch will immediately start running
- Start the sketch over by clicking the rest button on the board itself
#### Functions
- setup()
  - Initializes serial monitor and Bluetooth communication
  - Connects stepper motors to the correct pins
  - Enables CNC shield
- loop()
  - Sets speed and acceleration of each motor
  - Checks for bytes coming in over Bluetooth
  - Writes a full set of pitch, yaw, and roll angles to a string then stores values as floats
  - Checks for bad data coming in by comparing to previous data
  - Converts YPR angles to DCM
  - Converts DCM to PYR angles
  - Set the target position of each motor
  - Moves each motor to target position
  - Stores pitch, yaw, and roll angles to be compared to next data
- EulerYPR_to_DCM()
  - Converts angles coming into the phone to a directional cosine matrix
- DCM_to_EulerPYR()
  - Converts directional cosine matrix to the angles the motors need to move to
